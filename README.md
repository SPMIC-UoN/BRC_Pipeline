# BRC Pipeline

The BRC Pipeline scripts are being released for processing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. This processing pipeline could be applied to different modalities such as T1w/T2w MRI, diffusion MRI, and functional MRI datasets. Also, it can be used for the functional connectivity and network analysis.

# Installation
The instruction of step by step installation is available at the [Release Notes, Installation, and Usage][release-install-use] document
  for the current release.

# Support
Before contacting us, please try the following:

1. The [wiki][wiki_md] has tutorials on how to install and run the pipeline for different modalities.
2. Common issues are described in the [FAQ][faq_md]
If that doesn't work, you can get in touch with us!
